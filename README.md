# Capstone Project

## Objective

A security incident occurred involving unauthorized access to our system. The Attacker possible gained access
through a brute force attack, and then could extracted sensitive information from the database, now they
claimed to possess sensitive information

### Skills Learned

- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
- Incident Detection and Analysis: Develop the ability to detect signs of a security breach and analyze how the attacker gained access. 
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Vulnerability Management and Patching: Learn how to identify, assess, and address vulnerabilities within systems and applications.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Communication and Reporting: Develop effective communication skills for reporting the incident to stakeholders, including internal teams, management, and possibly affected customers.
- Data Protection and Risk Assessment.

### Tools Used


- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark, GreenBone by OpenVAS) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- forensics tools Like Autopsy.
